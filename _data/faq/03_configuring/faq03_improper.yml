Q: Why can't my publisher establish a connection with a remote subscriber?

A: While there can be multiple reasons for inter-host communication
 failure, this entry deals with connection establishment failures
 due to improper endpoint configuration.
 
 The configuration option "local_address" represents the endpoint address.
 This host/port tuple is used by the publisher to initiate connection
 establishment. In order to allow inter-host communication, make sure the
 endpoint address is publicly visible.
 
 A common mistake is to re-use the configuration provided in the
 exercises without modifications. Since the examples are intended to
 be run on an intra-host environment, they generally use the 'localhost'
 interface. This configuration will fail when the test is run in an
 inter-host setting.
