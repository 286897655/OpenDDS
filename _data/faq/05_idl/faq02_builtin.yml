Q: How do I use sequences of built-in types in IDL?

A: |
 If you'd like to use a sequence of one of the following IDL built-in types:
 <ul>
 <li>boolean, octet</li>
 <li>char, wchar, string, wstring</li>
 <li>float, double, long double</li>
 <li>short, long, long long</li>
 <li>unsigned short, unsigned long, unsigned long long</li>
 </ul>
 TAO already has a typedef for these sequences, the typedef name is the name of the built-in type in CamelCase with a "Seq" suffix (unsigned types use a "U" prefix, such as "ULongSeq").<br/>
 To use the existing typedef, add an #include for the pidl file from the tao directory:
 <pre>
 #include &lt;tao/LongSeq.pidl&gt;
 </pre>
 The typedefs are in the "CORBA" IDL module, so the typedef for LongSeq could be used as:
 <pre>
 struct X {
   CORBA::LongSeq seq;
 };
 </pre>
