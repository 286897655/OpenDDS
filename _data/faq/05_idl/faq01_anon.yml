Q: Why don't anonymous IDL sequences compile?

A: |
 Anonymous IDL sequences use the sequence keyword outside of a typedef:
 <pre>
  struct X {
    sequence&lt;Y&gt; seq;
  };
 </pre>
 Anonymous sequences have been deprecated in the OMG IDL specification.
 OpenDDS no longer supports using anonymous sequences, instead use a typedef
 to name the sequence type:
 <pre>
  typedef sequence&lt;Y&gt; YSeq;
  struct X {
    YSeq seq;
  };
 </pre>
