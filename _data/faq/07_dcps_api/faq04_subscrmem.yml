Q: What could account for increasing memory usage in subscribing processes?

A: If the subscribing process contains Data Readers which have received many
 instances from the corresponding Data Writers, it will need some resources to
 track each instance.  This can be bounded by the RESOURCE_LIMITS QoS policy and
 by the subscribing application take()ing samples from the Data Reader.
 The READER_DATA_LIFECYCLE QoS policy may also be helpful.
