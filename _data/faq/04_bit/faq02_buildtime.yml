Q: How do I turn off BIT support at build-time?

A: >
 It is possible to build OpenDDS without BIT support which will reduce overall footprint. For this you will need to generate new project files:
 <pre>
     mwc.pl -type &lt;yourtype&gt; -features built_in_topics=0 DDS.mwc
 </pre>

 If &lt;yourtype&gt; happens to be gnuace, add "built_in_topics=0" to the
 platform_macros.GNU file or the MAKEFLAGS environment variable.
 Alternatively, use the configure script with "--no-built-in-topics".
