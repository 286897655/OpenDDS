Q: Summarize the network connections established by OpenDDS in a two participant scenario?

A: >
 <summary>This scenario has two participants (one only publishes and the other only subscribes) using the TCP transport
   with no Built-In Topics.  The DCPSInfoRepo is used for discovery.
   Here we would expect to see three established TCP connections at each participant:</summary>

 <details><OL>
 <LI>The participant contacts the InfoRepo over IIOP (CORBA).  The endpoint used for this connection can be supplied as:
 <PRE>   -DCPSInfoRepo HOST:PORT</PRE>
 (or a similar setting in the .ini file)<BR>
 The HOST is obviously the host where the InfoRepo is running.  The PORT
 for the InfoRepo can be controlled by passing an argument to the
 InfoRepo process:
 <PRE>   -ORBListenEndpoints iiop://:PORT</PRE>
 Another option that's useful for port-forwarding solutions such as NAT
 traversal and SSH tunneling is hostname_in_ior.  This gets appended to
 the endpoint like so
 <PRE>   -ORBListenEndpoints iiop://:PORT/hostname_in_ior=HOST_ALIAS</PRE>
 Where HOST_ALIAS is a hostname (or dotted-decimal IP) that can be used
 by the client to contact the server.  In the NAT traversal example, the
 HOST_ALIAS would be the external side of the NAT and the PORT would be
 the port that's forwarded to the host running the server.<BR>
 You can also specify more than one endpoint (just repeating the
 <EM>-ORBListenEndpoints</EM> will work) so you can provide endpoints that will
 work for both "inside" and "outside" clients.<p>
 
 
 <LI>The InfoRepo will make an IIOP connection *back* to the participant.
  This is just the inverse of connection #1, but there is no equivalent
 to the <EM>-DCPSInfoRepo corbaloc:...</EM> option.  It's not necessary because
 the InfoRepo knows how to find the participant already (from data
 transmitted over connection #1).  To control the endpoint here, use the
 same <EM>-ORBListenEndpoints ...</EM> option but this time with the participant
 and not the InfoRepo.<p>
 
 <LI>Once the publishing participant and the subscribing participant have
 been associated, they connect directly using the tcp transport (by default)
 instance in each one. Here the endpoint is determined by the
 subscriber's transport config (the "local_address" value).  Unfortunately
 there is no equivalent to the <EM>hostname_in_ior</EM> for DDS transports.
 </OL></details>
