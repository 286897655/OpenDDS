Q: Does OpenDDS use CORBA?

A: OpenDDS optionally uses CORBA to administer and control the establishment of data connections
   (when configured to use the DCPSInfoRepo for discovery, which is the default). CORBA is never
   used in the distribution of application data.  When configured for RTPS peer-to-peer discovery,
   the CORBA libraries (TAO) are present but not used for any inter-process communication at all.  When configured for Safety Profile, which uses RTPS, no TAO libraries are used at runtime.
